# Learning journal

13.09.2024

 today i am dealing with dowmloading all the neccessary apps for my Project.
 i had also some problems with mySQl databases today, because i could not connect to it. But i managed to do that.
 Iâ€™ve been working on setting up a Docker environment to streamline my development workflow. The process has been both challenging and rewarding, as it involved configuring docker-compose to orchestrate multiple services, such as MySQL.  I encountered several issues, but each challenge has deepened my understanding of Docker and containerization.
 today i am gong to start working on my portflio website and this week my interntions also include to to create a blinking LED on my  Arduino Uno, as it was told in Knowledge base.
 so today most of the time i was working with my terminal, dealing with mySql and Docker, checking my assignments and checking my standart kit.
 i also tried to solder, but i suppose i need to improve it, as i suppose i have not done it correctly in a proper way .





Your learning journal can be seen as a diary of your learning process. It is a place where you can reflect on your learning, and where you can keep track of your progress. It is also a place where you can keep track of your questions, and where you can write down your answers to those questions.

So for example when you receive feedback on your project, you can write down the feedback and your reflection on it in your learning journal. You can also write down what you have learned from the feedback, and how you will apply it in your project.
