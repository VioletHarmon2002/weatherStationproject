 today i am dealing with dowmloading all the neccessary apps for my Project.
 i had also some problems with mySQl databases today, because i could not connect to it. But i managed to do that.
 Iâ€™ve been working on setting up a Docker environment to streamline my development workflow. The process has been both challenging and rewarding, as it involved configuring docker-compose to orchestrate multiple services, such as MySQL.  I encountered several issues, but each challenge has deepened my understanding of Docker and containerization.
 today i am gong to start working on my portflio website and this week my interntions also include to to create a blinking LED on my  Arduino Uno, as it was told in Knowledge base.
 so today most of the time i was working with my terminal, dealing with mySql and Docker, checking my assignments and checking my standart kit.
 i also tried to solder, but i suppose i need to improve it, as i suppose i have not done it correctly in a proper way .

 i had a lasercut workshop today, where we were having a tutorial of how to cut properly with laser, using various materials 
 right after explanantion, we tried to make it without teacher help

im still dealing with soldering today, right after this i am going to connect stuff to the WeMOS as see how it goes
i was also thinking about the desigh of my products, i may combine 3d printer and laser cutting for my physical ptoject 
another question of the day is how i can use fusion for prototyping

today we had three different presentations, about front-end, back-end and databases
i learnt a few new things about these 3 crucial parts in our projects, so i can impplement everything
i had a problem with connecting my microcontroller to my mac using hub, but eventually it worked, so i could also connect Internet on my WeMos.
i spent some time today to go through all the documentation, especially knowledge base, so i can i deeper understanding in whole structure.

Your learning journal can be seen as a diary of your learning process. It is a place where you can reflect on your learning, and where you can keep track of your progress. It is also a place where you can keep track of your questions, and where you can write down your answers to those questions.

So for example when you receive feedback on your project, you can write down the feedback and your reflection on it in your learning journal. You can also write down what you have learned from the feedback, and how you will apply it in your project.
