# Database

Thsi document descibes the database structure and relationships used in the Smart Time Regisatration project. The database is being designed to store information related to the devices, sensors, outputs and status messages.



1. Database structure:

Tables:

1.1 Devices Table 

Stores information about each device connected to the system, such as the embedded device (ESP8266)

![Devices Table](docs/assets/new.png)

1.2 Sensors Table

Stores data from sensors attached to the devices, including temperature, humidity, and light readings.

1.3 StatusMessages Table

Logs the status messages received from or sent to the embedded device. This could include alerts, system status updates, or other operational messages.

1.4 Outputs Table 

Stores information about the outputs (like the buzzer, LED, or LCD display) generated by the device.

2.  Database Interaction

When the embedded device sends sensor data, for instance temperature, humidity,light, it is stored in Sensors table. So the web application retrieves data from the database and allows users do view device outputs and status messages on the front-end.
