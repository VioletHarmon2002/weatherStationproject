# Smart time registration 



The purpose of the "Smart Time Registration" blueprint is to create an IoT-based system that tracks and manages time-related tasks using microcontrollers. 
This system captures data from sensors and sends it to a backend application over HTTP or HTTPS for processing. In return, the embedded device receives status messages from the backend, allowing real-time communication
