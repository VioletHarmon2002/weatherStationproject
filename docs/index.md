# Weather Station

The "Weather Station" project uses a WeMos D1 Mini microcontroller to track temperature and humidity. It has sensors that collect data and show it on an LCD screen. A red LED lights up when the temperature is above zero degrees Celsius, and a blue LED lights up when it's below zero.

The data is also sent to my website, so users can check the real-time temperature, humidity, and time updates from anywhere. This simple setup helps people stay informed about the weather conditions around them.

Below is the schematic of my project, designed in Fritzing, which visually represents the components and their connections
