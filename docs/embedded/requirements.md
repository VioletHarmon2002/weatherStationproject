# Requirements

![Devices Table](/assets/systemreq.jpg)

For my project i need to:

1. EMBRQ#01: SENDING DATA TO BACKEND
To implement the communication using HTTP protocol where the ESP8266 sends sensor data (temperature, humidity, light) from KY-015 and KY-018 sensors to a backend server. The data is sent over HTTP using WiFiClient and HTTPClient.
2. EMBRQ#02: RECEIVING DATA FROM BACKEND
The ESP8266 is configured as a server to receive status updates from the backend. It listens to incoming requests and processes commands (such as setting alarms or updating the clock).
3. EMBRQ#03: AT LEAST TWO TYPES OF INPUT SENSORS
I want to  connect two input sensors: the KY-015 (Temperature and Humidity Sensor) and the KY-018 (Photo Resistor) to the ESP8266. These sensors provide temperature, humidity, and light data.
4. EMBRQ#04: AT LEAST TWO TYPES OF VISUAL OR SENSORY OUTPUTS
I want to implement an LCD display and a buzzer as visual and sensory outputs. The LCD displays real-time data, while the buzzer can be used to alert users for alarms or other notifications.
5. EMBRQ#05: WIFI MANAGER
The embedded device must use WiFiManager for configuration of SSID and password (PWD) for connecting to the network.


To build your embedded device you need to have a clear idea of the requirements. On this page you can describe the requirements of your embedded device. This includes the requirements from DLO, but also your own requirements.
