# Concept & Design

1. User Concept:

The Smart Climate Monitor project aims to create an easy-to-use device that provides real-time temperature, humidity, and time information, along with visual indicators for temperature conditions. The goal is to enhance user awareness of their environment and ensure comfort and safety

2. User Interface Design

The target audience includes:
Environmental friendly people who want to use environmental friendly product, which produces not a lot carbon emissions.
Smart Weather Station seeks to supply those who care about the environment an affordable, and collectible real-time accurate environmental data to increase awareness in sustainable living. Eco-conscious customers can modify their behavior to make a smaller footprint and help save energy, water along with other resources . The weather station itself is energy-efficient with low-power sensors and to reduce its environmental footprint

User Needs:  Temperature, humidity and light readings on demand, moreover the  weather station provides accurate results for temperature, humidity and light Feasible: Using components such as DHT11 and KY-018, to capture light intensity and humidity making ESP8266 connected via WiFi network for real-time status.

3. Physical product and the interaction with the produ

The Smart Weather Station comes in a custom made wooden enclosure with plywood precision laser cut. The box is a part of the product's eco-friendly nature, being made from wood and all. The use of sustainably sourced plywood is designed to offer the highest level of sustainable credentials, while being both efficient and practical. The wooden box shared efficient dimensions to contain the weather station, without requiring too much real estate on usersâ€™ properties: a simple user wish for less environmental harm.
