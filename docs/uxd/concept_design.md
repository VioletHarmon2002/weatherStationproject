# Concept & Design

1. User Concept:

The Smart Climate Monitor project aims to create an easy-to-use device that provides real-time temperature, humidity, and time information, along with visual indicators for temperature conditions. The goal is to enhance user awareness of their environment and ensure comfort and safety

2. User Interface Design

LCD Display

Single Press of Button: Displays the current time (retrieved using NTP) in an easy-to-read format (e.g., HH:MM
).

Double Press of Button: Shows the current temperature and humidity levels (e.g., "Temp: 25°C, Humidity: 60%").
LED Indicators

Blue LED: Lights up when the temperature is below 0°C. This alerts users that it’s freezing.

Red LED: Lights up when the temperature is above 0°C. This informs users that the temperature is above freezing, indicating normal conditions.

Button for Interaction

A single button will allow users to toggle between displaying the real-time clock and the temperature/humidity readings. This keeps the interface simple.

3. Using 3D Printing to Create a Real Product

Component Placement:
Front Panel:  a slot for the LCD display for easy visibility.
LED Openings: small holes for the LEDs to protrude or be seen clearly through transparent plastic.
Sensor Mounts:  appropriate holes or vents in the design for the humidity sensor and photoresistor to function optimally.
A slot in the front or side panel of the case where the button will be accessible to the user.
