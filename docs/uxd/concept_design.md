### User Needs for the Box

- **Basic Structure**: As a user, I want the box to have a simple, open-top design to facilitate easy access to the internal components and sensors.
- **Sustainable Materials**: As a user, I want the box to be made from eco-friendly materials.
- **Ease of Assembly**: As a user, I want the box to be easy to assemble and disassemble, allowing for quick modifications or repairs.
- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: As a user, I want the box to have a clean and minimalist look, which complements its functional purpose without unnecessary embellishments.
- **Component Protection**: As a user, I want the box to provide basic protection for the internal components, ensuring they remain secure and functional.

### Main Goal

The main goal of the Smart Weather Station, from the user's perspective, is to provide an easy-to-use, eco-friendly device that delivers real-time environmental data.
The goal is to create a box, which is a part of the product's eco-friendly nature, being made from wood and having minimalistic design and to be easy to assemble.

## 2. Product Requirements for the Box

The requirements for the box are designed to be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound):

- **Material**: The box must be made from 100% sustainably sourced plywood to ensure eco-friendliness.
- **Dimensions**: The box should have compact dimensions of 10x10x10 cm to fit seamlessly into various environments.
- **Durability**: The box must withstand environmental conditions such as humidity and temperature fluctuations without degrading.
- **Manufacturing**: The box should be precision laser-cut to ensure minimal waste and high accuracy in production.
- **Aesthetic**: The box should maintain a natural wood finish to align with the eco-friendly design.
- **Protection**: The box must effectively protect internal components while allowing sensors to function.

## 3. Physical Product and Interaction

The Smart Weather Station features a custom-made wooden enclosure with precision laser-cut plywood. The design is compact, measuring 10x10x10 cm, ensuring it fits seamlessly into any environment without occupying excessive space. The choice of wood not only aligns with the eco-friendly ethos but also provides durability and a natural aesthetic.

The wooden box ensures that the internal components are protected while allowing the sensors to function effectively.


## 4. Digital Manufacturing & Material

### Justification for Material and Manufacturing Technique

Laser cutting is chosen as the manufacturing technique for its precision and speed, allowing for efficient production with minimal waste. Also, I have visited a lesson, where we were taught, how to make a box from wood. I was excited to see, how can I make my own from scratch, so I can use it for my own project,

Sustainably sourced plywood is selected for its strength, ease of laser cutting, and minimal environmental impact. This material fits the concept best due to its durability and natural aesthetic, aligning with the eco-friendly ethos of the project.

### Material Properties

The properties of the chosen material, sustainably sourced plywood, are ideal for the concept due to:

- **Strength**: Provides durability and protection for the internal components.
- **Ease of Manufacturing**: Compatible with laser cutting, allowing for precise and efficient production.
- **Aesthetic**: Aligns with the eco-friendly design.

## 5. Digital Design

### Software Choices

The software selected for the design process fits the project's goals, materials, and devices used. I have used the MakerCase tool (https://ru.makercase.com/#/) to design the digital box, providing an intuitive platform for generating precise box designs tailored to the project's specifications.

MakerCase is a web application designed for creating boxes or enclosures for laser cutters and CNC milling machines. It operates directly in a web browser and automatically generates a cutting template based on user specifications. Users can specify the desired dimensions and material thickness, and MakerCase generates a three-dimensional model of the box that can be freely rotated for inspection.

MakerCase offers options for creating boxes with smooth edges or finger joints, and it can generate both open and closed boxes. Once the box design is finalized, MakerCase converts the 3D model into a 2D drawing and generates an SVG or DXF file. These files can be sent directly to a CNC laser cutter or milling machine. The tool also allows for cutting compensation, laser beam thickness adjustments, and adding dog-bone fillets to inner corners for CNC machining paths.


### Design Process Documentation

Here are the steps i went through during my design process: 

- **Initial Conceptualization**: Brainstorming sessions and sketches were created to outline the basic structure and functionality of the weather station box.
- **Software Utilization**: MakerCase was employed to translate initial sketches into digital designs. The tool's intuitive interface allowed for easy adjustments to dimensions and material specifications.
- **Challenges and Solutions**: I had some problems, related to the sizes of the box, it was quite hard for me, especially the first time, to understand, how can i fit my breadboard and sensors to the box. 
- **Finalization**: The final design was reviewed and approved by myself.
