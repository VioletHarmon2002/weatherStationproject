## Device and Material Specifications

The Smart Weather Station is constructed using a custom-made wooden enclosure, crafted from sustainably sourced plywood. The specifications for the device and materials are as follows:

- **Material**: 100% sustainably sourced plywood
  - **Left and Right Sides**: 20 cm length x 10 cm width
  - **Bottom**: 20 cm length x 12 cm width
  - **Other Left and Right Sides**: 10 cm x 10 cm
- **Device Components**: Includes sensors for temperature, humidity, and light levels, along with a display for real-time data monitoring.

## Manufacturing Settings

The manufacturing process involves precision laser cutting to ensure minimal waste and high accuracy. 
The settings used are:

- **Laser Cutter**
- **Power**: 60%
- **Speed**: 30%
- **Frequency**: 5000 Hz
- **Focus**: Auto-focus enabled


## Optimizations

Several optimizations were made to improve the manufacturing process:

- **Eco-Friendly Materials**: As an eco-friendly person, I utilized reused materials. Specifically, I used plywood that was left over from a laser cutting class. This wood had enough space for my box, allowing me to reduce waste and promote sustainability.
- **Increased Speed**: By adjusting the laser speed to 30%, the cutting time was reduced by 20% without compromising quality.
- **Material Utilization**: The layout of the components was optimized to minimize material waste.
