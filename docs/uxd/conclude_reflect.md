# Conclude & Reflect

 Cutting Experience: 
 The most difficult part was the process of laser cutting wood to build housing for  own Smart Weather Station. 
 At first, I was really struggling to learn how the laser settings worked and where to position everything. In the end, it turned out to be a little more complicated than anticipated because they had such precise cuts for how everything was installed. I failed a couple of times as my first two tries were not correctly.
In each case, the panels didn't fit or the cuts were too shallow / deep. It ended up taking me longer, with three tries to get the final accurate shot I was aiming for. Yes, on the third shot I hit my mark perfectly and all of the pieces now nuzzle up to each other.
I learned a lot from this experience â€” the benefits of trial and error in design, to thoroughly test machinery before going on to make final versions. If I was to do this again, there would be more test cuts and alignment checking before finally doing.

Here, how i was constructing my prototype, with all the measurments
